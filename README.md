# Automatic-Table-Functions

This was made by [RoyallyFlushed](https://www.roblox.com/users/29942409/profile). This is a very useful system that allows you to create a new table and attach functions to a key within that table and have it fire when a key is changed. This allows you to set up functions that will automatically cast your data onto a UI object just by simply changing the value in the table and connecting an appropriate function to the attribute.
