# Automatic-Table-Functions

This is a very useful system that allows you to create a new table and attach functions to a key within that table and have it fire when a key is changed. This allows you to set up functions that will automatically cast your data onto a UI object just by simply changing the value in the table and connecting an appropriate function to the attribute.
